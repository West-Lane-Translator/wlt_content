**We plan to replace some of our transmission equipment during
the afternoon of Wednesday, June 12 in order to improve the
reliability and quality of our signals.  It is anticipated that the
broadcasting of the KLSR (34.x) and KEZI (9.x) channels will be
briefly interrupted but other stations will not be affected.**
