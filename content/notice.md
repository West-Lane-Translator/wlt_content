**It was discovered today that OPB's transmitter on Glenada Hill had
failed.  There were already plans to replace it with a new transmitter
and that was done at approximately 1:00 PM today.  The transmitter
that was replaced today and the two transmitters that we proactively
replaced last week were all older and obsolete.  All of our
transmitters are the same modern model now that those three
transmitters have been replaced which should improve the signal
quality and reliability of KEPB (28.x), KEZI (9.x) and KLSR (34.x).**

**Please accept our apologies for the unanticipated interruption of
OPB's service.**
