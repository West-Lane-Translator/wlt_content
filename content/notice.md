KLSR (HDTV 34.1) and KEVU (34.2) are currently off the air in the
Florence area.  To diagnose the problem, more sophisticated test
equipment has been requested which will probably not be available
until after the weekend.

In addition, it has been reported the KEPB (28.1) is repeatedly having
video quality issues.  This will also be investigated.

Please accept our apologies for this unanticipated interruption of
service.</b>
