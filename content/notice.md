**January 17, 2024**

**Over the past week, we have experienced and are continuing to
experience problems due to the weather in Eugene and the Coast Range.
The signals that we retransmit to the Florence community are
transmitted to our Glenada site via antennas to the east of us. Those
antennas are getting coated with ice and are unable to transmit the
signal to our site until the ice is cleared from them.**

**At last report, many of our
channels are off the air in the Florence area.  We will endeavor to
continue to keep the Eugene broadcasters informed of our local
outages.**

**Please accept our apologies for this unanticipated interruption of
service.**
