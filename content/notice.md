**KMTR (NBC) and KVAL (CBS) along with their subchannels (16.x and
13.x) are currently off the air in the Florence area.  A lightning
strike in Eugene damaged the fiber optic equipment that transmits
their programming to Florence.  Engineers are working on getting the
link restored or finding an alternative.  We do not yet know when
service will be restored, but this notice will be updated as more
information becomes available.**

**Please accept our apologies for this unanticipated interruption of
service.**
