**January 21, 2024**

**KLSR (Fox on 34.1) and KEVU (My TV on 34.2) are still off the air in
the Florence area.  Their transmitter on Walker Mountain is not
transmitting a signal to our Glenada Hill site.  They hope to be able
to restore service sometime this week.**

**In addition, the OPB family of channels (28.x) are also off the air
in the Florence area.  Our volunteers will endeavor to continue to
keep the Eugene broadcasters informed of our local outages.**

**Please accept our apologies for this unanticipated interruption of
service.**
