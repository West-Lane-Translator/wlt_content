**We plan to replace some of our transmission equipment sometime
during the week of June 10th in order to improve the reliability and
quality of our signals.  Currently, it is anticipated that KLSR and
KEZI will be off the air for less than one hour each and other
stations will not be affected, but this notice will be updated as
details are finalized.**
