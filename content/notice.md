**January 21, 2024**

**The OPB family of channels (28.x), KLSR (Fox on 34.1) and KEVU (My
TV on 34.2) are off the air in the Florence area.  Their signals come
to our Glenada Hill site via transmitters on Walker Mountain which has
lost power.  A repair crew will attempt to reach the site on Monday
(1/22) using a snowcat and chainsaws.**

**Please accept our apologies for this unanticipated interruption of
service.**
