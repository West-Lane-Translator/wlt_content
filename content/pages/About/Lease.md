Communications Facility Leasing
-------------------------------

::: {.clear-block}
::: {#node-62 .node}
::: {.content .clear-block}
West Lane Translator Incorporated owns and operates a substantial
communications tower in the Florence, Oregon market. Our facilities are
located at the top of Parachute Hill, south of the Siuslaw River and Old
Town Florence. We currently have available tower inventory at all levels
for lease. [Contact us](http://www.westlanetv.org/contact) for a
consultation on how we can assist your business in achieving its
communications goals.

-   
-   **COVERAGE**\
    Whether your requirements are for point-to-point, land mobile
    two-way, cellular, broadcast or broadband, West Lane Translator can
    supply the most complete coverage in Florence and western Lane
    County. Our 240-foot, self-supporting tower has unobstructed
    line-of-sight to all of the Florence market, as well as Dunes
    City/Westlake, parts of Siltcoos Lake, Highway 101 from Heceta Head
    to north Douglas County and east up Highway 126 as far as Mapleton.
    No other tower in the area provides as much open propagation as
    WLT\'s
-   **SECURITY**\
    Public access to the private forest land surrounding WLT\'s compound
    is restricted by locked gates and patrolled by the landowner. The
    tower and supporting facilities are further protected by security
    fencing and a second locked gate.
-   **RELIABILITY**\
    The Valmont tower at our facility was designed and built to survive
    a 9.0 earthquake, it meets all current tower specifications.
    Additionally, WLT maintains a permanently-installed, 40kW diesel
    generator to provide backup power to user\'s equipment in the event
    of a power failure. The site is served by utility power, underground
    telephone service, and fiber-optic cable. Three-phase utility power
    is nearby.
-   **STABILITY**\
    West Lane Translator has maintained this site since 1959. Continuing
    stewardship of this facility is one of WLT\'s primary goals.
-   **EASE OF ACCESS**\
    Our facilities are accessible year-round due to the relatively mild
    weather in this part of the state. The gravel road into the site is
    well-maintained, and not overly rugged. Four-wheel-drive is not a
    necessity to access the site. Sanitary facilities are provided for
    the use of our tenants, workers and visitors as well as personnel of
    adjoining facilities.
-   **ROOM TO GROW**\
    All levels of the tower are available for the mounting of antenna
    apparatus. If your equipment installation needs are modest, we have
    equipment rack space available in our climate-controlled main
    building. Users requiring more space or needing their own equipment
    shelters will find that there is ample area adjacent to the tower,
    needing minimal preparation for use. Base-of-tower outdoor-installed
    equipment is easily accommodated as well.
-   **VALUE**\
    WLT\'s lease offerings are competitively priced.

To learn more about our facilities and set up a consultation to discuss
your needs, please use our [Contact
Form](http://www.westlanetv.org/contact) to submit an inquiry. Someone
from our organization will respond to your message shortly.
