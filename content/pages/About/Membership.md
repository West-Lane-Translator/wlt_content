As WLT is a 501(c)(4) non-profit corporation, your contributions are
not tax deductible, but they do help us to keep the free, over-the-air
programming coming. The Officers and Board of Directors serve on a
volunteer basis, there are no paid staff members. Professional
services such as accounting, legal advice, and engineering are paid
modestly on an hourly basis when needed. You can be sure that your
contribution will go directly to the necessary expenses of keeping
entertainment, news, and public safety information flowing into the
West Lane County airwaves.
