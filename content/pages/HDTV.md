West Lane Translator is the licensee of four HDTV digital television
translators in Florence. Together with a fifth licensee, Oregon Public
Broadcasting, we bring High Definition television to the Central Coast
area.

Because we are incorporated as a non-profit entity, we are able to offer
these television signals at no cost to the Florence and Central Coast
communities. All that is required of the viewer is a television receiver
of reasonably recent vintage and some manner of receiving antenna to
pick up the on-air signal.

High Definition television
provides a digital signal delivery path using on-air signals. Gone are
the days of pictures filled with snow, ghosts, and fading. Digital
delivery means flawless picture and sound quality, and offers enhanced
features on every channel.

The five HD television stations rebroadcast on WLT translators
originate their signals from Eugene. In order to retransmit these
signals in Florence, it is necessary to shift or "translate" the
channel numbers for each station.

Our five Member television stations providing programming are listed
in the table below in alphabetical order.  Clicking on either a
Station or Translator Callsign will take you to more detailed
information (including contact information) about it on the FCC's
website.

A few important notes on the information in this table:

* You will notice that both the Eugene and Florence channel numbers
 are listed in these tables. The Florence channel numbers (italicized)
 will only be useful to
 you the first time you receive the station's programming. After
 once entering the Florence channel number or allowing your HD
 television or HDTV converter box to scan for local stations, the
 set or converter will "learn" the relationship between the
 originating station's channel number and the translator's channel
 number. Thereafter, you will only need to know and enter the
 channel number of the "Eugene" station to view the programming you
 desire. The "Florence" channel number will no longer be necessary
 or have meaning in the operation of your HD receiver. Be sure to
 read the documentation that accompanied your HDTV receiver for more
 details.

* Each of the translators carries the programming content of one of
  the major networks on the main channel but because HDTV allows for
  the use of subchannels, each of the stations carries supplemental
  programming in addition to their regular network and
  locally-produced features. This means more choices for the viewer,
  still at no cost.  A decimal is appended to the end of the channel
  number (16**.1**, etc.) to indicate which subchannel you are
  selecting. The decimal tells your receiver which of the several
  available program streams you wish to view from the station. The
  x**.1** subchannel is always the "main" channel for that station.

* Cable and satellite services only provide you with the first, "main"
  channel of each of the local stations. You may be missing multiple
  programming choices offered on the HDTV subchannels, channels that
  subscription services don't offer under any of their service plans.
  Additionally, although the cable or satellite version of the local
  channels originates as an HDTV signal at the station, the
  programming is converted to analog before being delivered to your
  home. As a result, you are not getting the complete HDTV experience,
  you might just as well be watching any ordinary video feed. Only by
  receiving our on-air transmitted signals will you start enjoying the
  rich experience that all-digital HDTV can provide.

All of the transmitting equipment required to place these HDTV signals
on the air was new and placed on the air January 12, 2010. Due to
the efficiency of having matching equipment, each of the five stations
uses identical transmitters and the resulting signals are combined
electronically so that a master transmitting antenna can be utilized
from atop our new 240-foot tower on Glenada Hill, south of Florence. As
a result, and because the five TV stations have identical power output
levels of 2500 Watts E.R.P., robust signal strength in the area is
insured for each station.
