Title: Community Emergency Notification System (CENS)

The Community Emergency Notification System (CENS) is a phone system
utilized to call people on their land line phone if there is an
eminent threat to their well being. Most recently it was used during
the tsunami warning of March 11, 2011. Please be aware that if your
residence is not in the inundation area, you would not receive a CENS
notification to evacuate.

Until recently, emergency personnel would use CENS to call land-line
telephones but did not have the capability to include Wireless
(cellular) or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone
numbers. Now, owners of VoIP or cellular phone lines can receive the
same emergency message as those with land-line phones receive, but
only if they register.

CENS allows Public Safety Agencies in Lane County to identify an
affected area and, if necessary, send a message that describes the
situation and recommend protective actions residents should take. The
CENS system will automatically call out to all land-line and Alert Me
registered telephone numbers within that geographic area and deliver
the recorded message once a voice is heard. If your phone line is
busy, the system will attempt to redial the number three times to make
contact. If an answering machine picks up the call, the emergency
message will be left on the machine.

Some of the many uses of the system include:
* Tsunami Warnings
* Emergency Evacuations
* Natural Disaster Alerts
* Missing Child Alerts
* Hazardous Material Incidents
* Neighborhood Emergencies

As with any system, CENS has its limitations.

When linked to a specific address, the location of the cell phone
number becomes essentially fixed to that location. This could lead to
the situation of a cell phone being notified when the user is mobile
and well out of the affected area. Or conversely, the situation where
the user is mobile, is in the affected area, but is not notified
because the fixed location of the number is in an unaffected
area. Please consider this when registering cell phone information for
addition to the database.

In addition, it takes 2-3 weeks once a number has been registered for
it to be validated and entered into the database. If an incident
occurs in your neighborhood within that time period it is unlikely you
will receive the notification.

Keep in mind that CENS is an excellent enhancement to our effort to
share emergency information with our citizens, but registration will
not guarantee notification of any specific event. You are still
encouraged to visit Lane County Public Safety Agencies' websites and
to stay tuned to local news channels and radio stations during a
community crisis.

Another option is to purchase a NOAA ("weather") radio. These radios
broadcast NOAA alerts, such including tsunami warnings, and can be
programmed to turn on when normally not in use. The tsunami warning
sirens are designed to notify those who are outdoors in low lying
areas or on the beaches.

Frequently Asked Questions:
---------------------------

### Who should register for the CENS Alert Me notifications?

All cellular and VoIP phone subscribers within Lane County who wish to
receive CENS Alert Me notifications. Registering a mobile device or
VoIP telephone to an address will not affect any land-line telephones
already assigned to that location. To register, go to your public
safety agency website or
<http://www.ci.florence.or.us/community/register-your-cell-phone-receive-emergency-notification-alerts>.

### Do I need to register my regular telephone?

No, land-line telephones are already "registered" through the 9-1-1
system.

### How will I receive alerts?

When alerts are issued, they will be sent as e-mails, phone calls
(voice), and/or text messages. When you register your telephone
number, you will be asked to identify the type of device you are
registering. If you register your device as a “cellular telephone” you
will receive alerts as both a voice phone call and a text
message. Standard messaging rates imposed by your service provider
will apply to any text message alerts you receive. If you do not wish
to receive text message alerts, please do not register your device as
a “cellular telephone”; select one of the other device options that
are available. If you register your cell phone as something other than
a “cellular telephone”, you will still receive phone call (voice)
alerts, but you will not receive text messages.

### Will my information be sold or distributed?

No. All of the information you enter will feed directly into the CENS
secure database. This information can only be accessed by system
administrators and the data will never be sold or distributed to third
parties.

### When will I receive phone calls?

You will receive phone calls when CENS is activated and your address
is within the geographic area chosen to receive the notification
message. CENS will only be activated for emergency purposes such as:
tsunami warnings, emergency evacuations, natural disaster alerts,
missing child alerts, hazardous material leaks and neighborhood
emergency incidents.

### What do I do if I move or want to opt-out of Alert Me?

If you move after you have entered your information into the website
you will need to go back into the website and re-enter your
information with your new address. To unsubscribe from all alerts,
click Unsubscribe after logging into your account.

### Can I enter my telephone number more than once at different addresses? How many wireless and cellular numbers can be registered to one address?

Residents enter their name, address, and up to two phone numbers such
as cell phone numbers or VoIP phone numbers. Residents can register up
to five additional contacts to their accounts, such as parents,
siblings and spouses. Land-line telephone numbers are
automatically/already included in the CENS database and should not be
registered.

### Do I have to enter an actual address?

Yes. If you enter an address that does not exist you will not be in
the database and will not be contacted when CENS is activated.

### Will I be solicited in any way at the phone number that I enter?

No. You will only receive phone calls when CENS is activated and your
address is within the geographic notification area chosen. CENS will
only be activated for emergency purposes.

### If I am in a location that is different than the address that I enter into the website for my cellular phone, will I still be contacted if an emergency affects the address entered?

Yes. No matter where you are physically located, you will only receive
calls for emergencies that affect the address entered into the
website. So if you are on vacation in a different state you will still
receive a phone call if the address you entered is affected by an
emergency.

### Does it cost me anything to opt-in for CENS messages?

This service is provided to you free of charge by Public Safety
Agencies in Lane County. However, please be aware that text message
charges may apply depending on your mobile service agreement and
service carrier. Contact your mobile service provider for details.
