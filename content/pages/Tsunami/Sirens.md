Florence Tsunami Siren Protocols
--------------------------------

::: {.clear-block}
::: {#node-45 .node}
::: {.content .clear-block}
**Siren Locations:**\
There are currently three sirens located in the Florence area:

-   One is at the Florence Justice Center (9th and Greenwood Streets)
-   One is on 35th Street near the tennis courts.
-   One is located at 3rd and Joshua Streets (Heceta Beach Rd. area).

A fourth siren was purchased by Lane County and will be installed at
Harbor Vista Park, which is in between the second and third sirens.

**The Siren Tones:**

The sirens are at high-power capacity and have 2400 watts of power that
cover up to a 4,000 ft radius. Optimum sound propagation conditions
exist when there are no obstructions in the sound path, which means that
wind speed and direction will be a prevailing factor in sound
projection.

-   The first tone is the TEST TONE, which is a long steady sound. The
    test tone will be activated on the last Friday of each month. It
    will last for a few minutes, beginning at 11 am. The test tone will
    be followed by the \'all clear\' tone (see below)
-   The second tone is the REAL TIME evacuation blast, known as a wail
    tone. Evacuation for a distant tsunami will generally be indicated
    by a siren blast and an announcement over NOAA weather radio that
    the local area has been put into an official TSUNAMI WARNING. The
    wail tone varies from a low to high warble sound. In isolated areas
    along the beaches and bays you may not hear a warning siren. A
    sudden change of sea level should prompt you to move immediately to
    higher ground. Should the evacuation blast be activated, first
    evacuate away from the shoreline areas, then turn your radio to KCST
    106.9 FM for more information.
-   The third tone is the ALL CLEAR sound, which resembles the
    Westminster Chimes. You will hear this tone if the tsunami warning
    has been cancelled. The protocols state that the \'all clear\' will
    run for one minute followed by a two minute rest period. This
    process will be repeated five times. At that time it is ok for
    people to return to their homes.

**What to do:**

-   The tsunami sirens are intended to be used as a warning when a
    distant tsunami approaches the shoreline. The primary focus of the
    sirens is to warn those who are outside in the inundation zone or
    those who are on the beach.
-   If you hear the REAL TIME evacuation tone, it is your signal to get
    to higher ground. There may be a window span of one to two hours for
    you to grab your emergency supplies and leave the inundation zone,
    but you must make the conscious decision ahead of time to leave the
    area when you hear this tone.
-   If you feel the earth shaking, get to higher ground immediately and
    do NOT wait for the sirens. An earthquake in the Florence area is an
    indicator that a tsunami will reach us in 10-15 minutes.
-   KCST Coast Radio 106.9 FM is the emergency broadcast station for
    Florence and its surrounding areas. They will provide further
    information on evacuations.
