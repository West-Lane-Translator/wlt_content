Florence Tsunami Evacuation Plan
--------------------------------

**City of Florence\
Tsunami Emergency Evacuation\
Protecting Yourself From a Tsunami**

Source: City of Florence, March 1999\
Amended: April, 2010

**1. If you feel an earthquake** when you are in the Florence area,
protect yourself from the effects of the quake by dropping, covering,
and holding on if you are inside and staying away from falling objects
if you are outside until the earthquake is over.

**2. Then** if you are in the tsunami inundation zone and even if you
have been frightened or hurt by the earthquake, you must immediately
move inland or to high ground, away from areas that could be affected by
tsunamis (see reverse side for inundation zone map).

Tsunamis can travel upstream in coastal rivers and estuaries and follow
low lying contours of the ground with damaging waves extending farther
inland than the immediate coastline. Do not wait for an official warning
because the tsunami may strike before authorities have time to issue a
warning.

Remember, all ocean beach areas and low lying areas along the Siuslaw
River and it's tributaries\
are considered to be in the tsunami inundation zone!

**3. If** you think you have time, get your disaster supply kit (see
City of Florence Fire Department Family Disaster Plan pamphlet).

**4. If** you are able, warn or help elderly or disabled neighbors.

**5. Do not return** to your home or inundation areas after the first
wave. Additional waves may arrive later, be higher, and go further
inland. Waves may continue to come in for several hours.

**6. Never go to the beach** to watch for a tsunami. Tsunamis move much
faster than a person can run. Also, incoming traffic hampers safe and
timely evacuation of coastal areas.

**7. If** you see a sudden and unexpected rise or fall in coastal water,
a tsunami may be approaching. Do not wait to investigate, because the
next wave may be a large tsunami. Instead move inland or uphill as
quickly as possible.

**8. Use the [map](http://www.westlanetv.org/gfx/tsunami_map.gif)** to
plan your evacuation route. Also download and read the [Tsunami
Evacuation
Brochure](http://www.westlanetv.org/files/FlorenceEvacBrochure-8-29-13.pdf)
for more information and a detailed map of inundation zones and
evacuation assembly areas in Florence.
