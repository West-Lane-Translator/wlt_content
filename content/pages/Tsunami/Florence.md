Florence Tsunami Evacuation Plan

**City of Florence\
Tsunami Emergency Evacuation\
Protecting Yourself From a Tsunami**

Source: City of Florence, March 1999\
Ammended: April, 2010

**1. If you feel an earthquake** when you are in the Florence area,
protect yourself from the effects of the quake by dropping, covering,
and holding on if you are inside and staying away from falling objects
if you are outside until the earthquake is over.

**2. Then** if you are in the tsunami inundation zone and even if you
have been frightened or hurt by the earthquake, you must immediately
move inland or to high ground, away from areas that could be affected by
tsunamis (see reverse side for inundation zone map).

Tsunamis can travel upstream in coastal rivers and estuaries and follow
low lying contours of the ground with damaging waves extending farther
inland than the immediate coastline. Do not wait for an official warning
because the tsunami may strike before authorities have time to issue a
warning.

Remember, all ocean beach areas and low lying areas along the Siuslaw
River and it's tributaries\
are considered to be in the tsunami inundation zone!

**3. If** you think you have time, get your disaster supply kit (see
City of Florence Fire Department Family Disaster Plan pamphlet).

**4. If** you are able, warn or help elderly or disabled neighbors.

**5. Do not return** to your home or inundation areas after the first
wave. Additional waves may arrive later, be higher, and go further
inland. Waves may continue to come in for several hours.

**6. Never go to the beach** to watch for a tsunami. Tsunamis move much
faster than a person can run. Also, incoming traffic hampers safe and
timely evacuation of coastal areas.

**7. If** you see a sudden and unexpected rise or fall in coastal water,
a tsunami may be approaching. Do not wait to investigate, because the
next wave may be a large tsunami. Instead move inland or uphill as
quickly as possible.

**8. Use the [map](http://www.westlanetv.org/gfx/tsunami_map.gif)** to
plan your evacuation route. Also download and read the [Tsunami
Evacuation
Brochure](http://www.westlanetv.org/files/FlorenceEvacBrochure-8-29-13.pdf)
for more information and a detailed map of inundation zones and
evacuation assembly areas in Florence.

### **EVACUATION ROUTES FOR THE FLORENCE AREA**

**SOUTHWEST SIDE OF FLORENCE:** Use Rhododendron Drive or 9th street to
get to Highway 101. Go North on 101 to at least 15th street. Use any
large parking lot and wait for additional information from local
emergency officials.

**SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST SIDE OF FLORENCE:** If you live in the area around
the Florence Events Center go to that location. Otherwise use available
streets to get to Highway 101. Go North on 101 to at least 15th street
and use any large parking lot. Wait for additional information from
local emergency officials.

**WEST AND NEAR NORTH SIDE OF FLORENCE:** 9th street and 35th street are
the main evacuation routes. Remain north of 15th street on 101. Use any
large parking lot and wait for the all clear from local emergency
officials. For residents of Greentrees West it may be safest to assemble
in the Greentrees East area and remain there until contacted by local
emergency officials.

**HECETA BEACH AND NORTH RHODODENDRON DRIVE AREA:** Use Heceta Beach
road or 35th street to get to Highway 101. Use any large parking area to
wait for emergency personnel. Do not attempt to drive into the city.

about Tsunami watches and warnings will be broadcast on KCST Radio,

MHz

life-threatening emergency.\
