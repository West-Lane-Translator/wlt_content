As WLT is a 501(c)(4) non-profit corporation, your contributions are not
tax deductible, but they do help us to keep the free, over-the-air
programming coming. The Officers and Board of Directors serve on a
volunteer basis, there are no paid staff members. Professional services
such as accounting, legal advice, and engineering are paid modestly on
an hourly basis when needed. You can be sure that your contribution will
go directly to the necessary expenses of keeping entertainment, news,
and public safety information flowing into the West Lane County
airwaves.
