Due to sale of spectrum by the FCC, West Lane Translator, Inc. was
recently required to change 3 of its channels. The translators for KVAL,
KMTR and KLSR were moved from channel 40, 43 and 51 respectively, to
channel 24, 26 & 28. When this occurred, viewers \"lost\" these stations
and needed to re-scan their televisions to \"find\" the new channels.
The change took place on December 7th.

After setting your TV to scan, and assuming that it successfully finds
the translators on their new channels, nothing will look any different
to you, the viewer. The three network stations will once again appear on
the same channel selections as before (channels 13, 16, and 34). Much of
this has to do with digital smoke and electronic mirrors, but that\'s
alright, you don\'t have to understand it fully, few of us here really
do either\...

If you have an inquisitive mind, a fast internet connection and some
spare time, you can gain a better understanding of why it was necessary
to change three of our channels by reading this rather complete
dissertation on Wikipedia:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_reallocation> . In the Florence
area, the spectrum was purchased at auction by T-Mobile, which intends
upon using their new frequencies soon. This has resulted in WLT, as well
as one other TV translator (channel 48), engaging in this channel move.
In order to complete the engineering studies and apply for new channel
frequencies, we were required to cooperate with other broadcasters in
Lane county to find interference-free schemes of channel assignment. It
was quite a feat, and much gratitude is due to those who figured out
this difficult frequency allotment puzzle.

WLT extends sincere appreciation to board and technical committee member
Dennis Hunt and to OPB engineer Jon Kenneke for their efforts to quickly
and completely make the channel change and recalibrate the necessary
transmission equipment.
