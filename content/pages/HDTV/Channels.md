Title: HDTV Channels

The five HD television stations rebroadcast on WLT translators
originate their signals from Eugene. In order to retransmit these
signals in Florence, it is necessary to shift or "translate" the
channel numbers for each station. This page will provide you with the
information necessary to understand the changes in station channel
numbers.

First, here is a table summarizing the shift in channel numbers:

Station | Eugene Channel | Florence Channel* | Network Affiliation | Translator Callsign
---- | ----- | ----- | --- | -------
KEPB | Ch 28 | Ch 32 | PBS | K32HF-D
KEZI | Ch 9 | Ch 35 | ABC | K35HW-D
KLSR | Ch 34 | Ch 28 | Fox | K28NZ-D
KMTR | Ch 16 | Ch 26 | NBC | K26NE-D
KVAL | Ch 13 | Ch 24 | CBS | K24MF-D

Because digital TV broadcasting allows for three program channels in
addition to the "main" channel, a decimal is appended to the end of
the channel number (16**.1**, etc.) to indicate which you are
selecting. The decimal tells your receiver which of the several
available program streams you wish to view from the station. The first
decimal (Ch x.1) is always the "main" channel for that station.

The following table illustrates the WLT translator channels and
sub-channels and the programming you can expect to view on each:

\* You will notice that both the Eugene and Florence channel numbers
are listed in these tables. This information will only be useful to
you the first time you receive the station's programming. After once
entering the Florence channel number or allowing your HD television or
HDTV converter box to scan for local stations, the set or converter
will "learn" the relationship between the originating station's
channel number and the translator's channel number. Thereafter, you
will only need to know and enter the channel number of the "Eugene"
station to view the programming you desire. The "Florence" channel
number will no longer be necessary or have meaning in the operation of
your HD receiver. Be sure to read the documentation that accompanied
your HDTV receiver for more details.
