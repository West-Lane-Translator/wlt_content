HD Television Channels
----------------------

The five HD television stations rebroadcast on WLT translators originate
their signals from Eugene. In order to retransmit these signals in
Florence, it is necessary to shift or "translate" the channel numbers
for each station. This page will provide you with the information
necessary to understand the changes in station channel numbers.

First, here is a table summarizing the shift in channel numbers:

Because digital TV broadcasting allows for three program channels in
addition to the "main" channel, a decimal is appended to the end of
the channel number (16**.1**, etc.) to indicate which you are selecting.
The decimal tells your receiver which of the several available program
streams you wish to view from the station. The first decimal (Ch x.1) is
always the "main" channel for that station.

The following table illustrates the WLT translator channels and
sub-channels and the programming you can expect to view on each:

* You will notice that both the Eugene and Florence channel numbers are
listed in these tables. This information will only be useful to you the
first time you receive the station's programming. After once entering
the Florence channel number or allowing your HD television or HDTV
converter box to scan for local stations, the set or converter will
"learn" the relationship between the originating station's channel
number and the translator's channel number. Thereafter, you will only
need to know and enter the channel number of the "Eugene" station to
view the programming you desire. The "Florence" channel number will no
longer be necessary or have meaning in the operation of your HD
receiver. Be sure to read the documentation that accompanied your HDTV
receiver for more details.\
