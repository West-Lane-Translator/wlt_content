Title: Cable and Satellite Subscribers

If you are a subscriber to cable or satellite television service, you
already know that the local TV signals are available to you. What you
may not know is that you are not getting the "whole picture"!

Cable and satellite services only provide you with the first, "main"
channel of each of the local stations. You may be missing multiple
programming choices offered on the HDTV subchannels, channels that
subscription services don't offer under any of their service plans.

Additionally, although the cable or satellite version of the local
channels originates as an HDTV signal at the station, the programming
is converted to analog before being delivered to your home. As a
result, you are not getting the complete HDTV experience, you might
just as well be watching any ordinary video feed. Only by receiving
our on-air transmitted signals will you start enjoying the rich
experience that all-digital HDTV can provide.

The very good news is that you can begin receiving these free,
through-the-air digital channels without sacrificing any of the other
programming you enjoy, and with only a minimal amount of effort
required to attach an antenna to your television receiver so that you
can receive our signals.

The links below will guide you to pages on this site that can inform
you about how to accomplish this.
