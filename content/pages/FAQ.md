What's this about "translators"? Do I need to know a foreign
language?

<div>

No special language skills are required. The term "Translator" is in
reference to the equipment that is used to transmit a signal, either
audio or video, on a frequency or channel different than it was
originally transmitted on. For example, a broadcast on TV channel 8 might
be received by translator equipment, and shifted either up or down,
perhaps to channel 45. The program content of the broadcast is unchanged
by the shift in channel, it is identical to the original. Shifting the
frequency of FM stations or the channel number of TV stations is
necessary to prevent interference to the originating station's
broadcast signal. See the [Channels and
Sub-Channels](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Channels) and [FM
Radio](http://www.westlanetv.org/FM) pages for additional information.

HDTV? What's that? Why do I need it?

<div>

HDTV stands for High Definition TeleVision, which is the current,
digital standard for all television broadcasts in the U.S. All
full-power television stations in the country were required to switch
over to this new digital standard and cease broadcasting in the old,
"analog" format in early 2010. In nearly all parts of the country, it
is the only type of on-air television broadcast available. Your
enjoyment of on-air television broadcasts is now enhanced by clearer,
crisper video images, stereophonic and surround sound of the highest
quality, and the complete absence of snow, ghosting, fading, and
distortion that the old system was prone to experience. See the [HDTV
Receivers](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Receivers) page for additional
information.HDTV also allows the originating station to supply up to
three additional program streams to be viewed. See the [Channels and
Sub-Channels](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Channels) page for
additional information.

I've tried receiving your broadcasts on my HD television, but see
nothing. Why?

<div>

There may be a variety of reasons, but first understand that you must
have an antenna connected to your television to receive anything. See
the [HDTV Antennas](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Antennas) page for
additional information.With an antenna, reception in most areas of
Florence and the surrounding area should be no problem. See the [HDTV
Coverage](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Coverage) page for additional
information and some helpful maps to determine if you can receive our
signals.Some HD televisions must be programmed to recognize on-air
broadcast signals. Consult your television's owners manual for
instructions on how to "scan" for stations.

</div>

My television is quite old. Can I still use it to receive your
broadcasts??

<div>

For the best viewing experience, we recommend that you purchase a newer
television. All receivers manufactured after 2007 are HDTV capable. You
do not need an elaborate system to view HDTV, even a modestly-priced
HDTV will provide you with significantly improved picture quality.
Alternately, "converter boxes" are manufactured to allow older sets to
receive HDTV signals. See the [HDTV
Receivers](http://www.westlanetv.org/HDTV/Receivers) page for additional
information.

</div>

I see that one of your FM radio stations is broadcasting in digital HD.
When will the remainder go HD?

<div>

HD Radio is still an option, rather than a mandate. As such, most radio
broadcasters are waiting to see how many HD radio receivers there will
be in the market, and how much interest the public has in buying them.
HD radio is *very* expensive to buy and install, so most broadcasters
are being cautious.

</div>

Every so often, I hear an unusual squawking noise on my FM radio.
What's that?

<div>

What you are hearing is most likely the alert signal tones and data
headers for the Emergency Alert System. The equipment for the EAS system
is tested each week to ensure it is properly functional. The EAS system
is an integral part of public safety in the event of an emergency, and
also is used to assist law enforcement in the event of a child
abduction. Get to know more about this essential service by reading our
[EAS Information Page](http://www.westlanetv.org/EAS).
