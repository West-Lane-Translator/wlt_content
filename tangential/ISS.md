<div>

In astronomy the brightness of any star is measured using the magnitude
scale. This method was devised originally by the Greeks, who classified
the stars as first magnitude (brightest) to sixth magnitude (dimmest).
This rough method was altered in the 1800's so that magnitude (mag.) 1
stars were defined as being exactly 100 times brighter than mag. 6
stars. Thus magnitude could be expressed as varying logarithmically with
the stars brightness. With the advent of accurate modern photometry the
scale was extended in both directions.

Thus at one extreme the Sun is magnitude (mag.) -27 and some of the
faintest observed stars around mag. +24. The full moon is mag. -12.5,
Sirius the brightest star in the night sky mag. -1.5, whilst the
faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good conditions are around
mag. +6.

The advantage of this method is, of course, that the stars are readily
at hand for comparison with a satellite (given knowledge of stellar
magnitudes).
