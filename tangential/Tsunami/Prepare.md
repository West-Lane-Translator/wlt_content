Tsunami Preparedness
--------------------

### **WHAT TO DO:**

If you feel an earthquake, a tsunami may be coming...

-   **DROP, COVER, HOLD** until the earthquake is over; protect yourself
-   **MOVE IMMEDIATELY INLAND** to high ground and away from low-lying
    coastal areas
-   **FOLLOW EVACUATION ROUTE SIGNS**
-   **DO NOT WAIT** for an official warning
-   **GO ON FOOT** if at all possible
-   **DO NOT PACK** or delay
-   **DO NOT RETURN** to the beach -- large waves may continue to come
    onshore for several hours
-   **WAIT** for an "all clear" from local emergency officials before
    returning to low-lying areas

  

### **BE PREPARED** before a tsunami strikes!

**How to help with tsunami awareness in your community:**

-   Start a tsunami buddy system
-   Make and distribute emergency packs
-   Initiate or participate in a local preparedness program

**Assemble emergency kits with at least a 3-day supply for each family
member:**

-   First-aid kit and reference guide
-   Water --- 1 gallon per person per day, for drinking, hygiene, and
    cooking
-   Food (packaged, canned, no-cook, as well as baby food and food for
    special diets)
-   Can opener (nonelectric)
-   Blankets or sleeping bags
-   Fire extinguisher (standard)
