Heceta Lighthouse Cam

**KEZI Cam**
============

Unfortunately, the camera that views the Heceta Lighthouse has been
disabled\
since Sea Lion Caves closed at the beginning of the Coronavirus
epidemic.\
We are hopeful that it will be restored soon.

 

This file image shows the view when the camera is working (and pointed
at the lighthouse):
